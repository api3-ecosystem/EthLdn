# Introduction to API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project that delivers Oracle services to smart contracts in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the [API3 DAO](https://api3.org/dao).

### Airnode and dAPIs

Airnode is a serverless function that lets API providers run their own oracle nodes. That way, they can provide data to any on-chain dApp that's interested in their services without an intermediary.

First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to verify the data source.

You can [learn more about first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/) or [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.html) within the API3 Documentation.

# API3 Oracles

### Data feeds: dAPIs

dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data. API3 data feeds can be accessed in two methods:

- Self-funded dAPIs see users add collateral for oracle operation and are permissionless. They provide a data feed source with off-chain aggregation as a single-source. 

- Managed dAPIs are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation offering a verifiable, decentralized oracle solution.

Once a dAPI has been integrated a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis).

### API3 QRNG 

API3 QRNG is a public utility API3 provides on behalf of well-established, prestigious organizations serving Quantum random number generation (QRNG). QRNG is a method of random number generation based on quantum phenomena and considered within the scientific community to be the most secure method of random number generation.

It operates as a public good, where users simply add gas to a wallet correlated to the oracle node, enabling the oracle node to return a random number when requested by a contract.

Learn more about QRNG within the [API3 explore section](https://docs.api3.org/explore/qrng/). 


# Get started with dAPIs

To get started all you have to do is import the `IProxy` interface and call the `read()` function.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "@api3/contracts/v0.8/interfaces/IProxy.sol";

contract DataFeedReaderExample {
    ...

    function readDataFeed()
        external
        view
        returns (int224 value, uint256 timestamp)
    {
        // proxyAddress is the address of the proxy contract for
        // the dAPI you want to read.
        // Head over to https://market.api3.org to get the proxy
        // address for the dAPI you want. 
        (value, timestamp) = IProxy(proxyAddress).read();
    } 
}
```
