# Introduction to API3
[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project that delivers Oracle services to smart contracts in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the [API3 DAO](https://api3.org/dao).
First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to verify the data source. API3's first-party oracles are powered by Airnode, a serverless oracle node that enables API providers to run their own oracle nodes.
You can [learn more about first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/) or [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.html) within the API3 Documentation.
### ChainAPI: Airnode integration tool
With ChainAPI your smart contract can connect almost any API, whether open or authenticated, by using API3's first-party oracle node, Airnode. ChainAPI enables you to integrate and deploy the open source Airnode with an intuitive step-by-step integration and deployment process.
### API3 QRNG
API3 QRNG is a public utility API3 provides on behalf of well-established, prestigious organizations serving Quantum random number generation (QRNG). QRNG is a method of random number generation based on quantum phenomena and considered within the scientific community to be the most secure method of random number generation.
It operates as a public good, where users simply add gas to a wallet correlated to the oracle node, enabling the oracle node to return a random number when requested by a contract.
Learn more about QRNG within the [API3 explore section](https://docs.api3.org/explore/qrng/).
### Data feeds: dAPIs
dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data. API3 data feeds can be accessed in two methods:
- Self-funded dAPIs see users add collateral for oracle operation and are permissionless. They provide a data feed source with off-chain aggregation as a single-source.
- Managed dAPIs are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation offering a verifiable, decentralized oracle solution.
Once a dAPI has been integrated a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis).

## Submission Requirements

All hackathon participants who are competing for the API3 bounties are required to submit a project that meets the following requirements:

- The project should be submitted to the ETH London Hackathon 2023 by the deadline.
- Use of API3â€™s self-funded dAPIs that facilitates a proper use-case.
- The project should be live with a working frontend deployed.
- The project should be open-source with a public Github repository with the codebase, 
- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT.

# Judging criteria

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?

- **Design**: How well-designed is the project? Is it easy to use? Is it visually appealing?

- **BONUS** - Adding functionality to the Airnode protocol that will improve performance, interoperability, or further develop use cases.
